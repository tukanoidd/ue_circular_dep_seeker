I created this for work, to be able to find the circular dependency in modified Unreal
Engine codebase. I work on Linux, so this was designed to work with Unreals CMake projects
only and I don't know if pathing will work on Windows but I guess you can try it out and see
if it's useful for you or not.

Initially made it as a console application but now am trying to make it into a fully fledged
GTK4 app to make it easier to use.

Feel free to contribute to expand and optimize this if you want, I'll merge the changes when
I can.
